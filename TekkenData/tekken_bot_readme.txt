------TEKKEN BOT README (https://github.com/roguelike2d/TekkenBot/releases)------
* Launch Tekken 7, then launch Tekken Bot by clicking on TekkenBotPrime.exe. Tekken Bot should automatically locate the running Tekken 7 instance and start reading its memory.
* Frame Data Overlay requires Tekken 7 to be in windowed or windowed borderless mode (switch first to windowed, THEN to borderless).
* Users with multiple monitors can get the overlay as a seperate, draggable window on their second monitor (display -> overlay_as_draggable_window).
* If you suspect frame data is wrong, setting the dummy to block and jump and then holding up will make the live frame data display (tiny number above the big number) show the jump timing difference in frames, which is extremely accurate. Mostly useful for Eliza and Akuma right now.
