------TEKKEN BOT README------
* Frame Data Overlay requires windowed or windowed borderless mode (switch first to windowed, THEN to borderless).
* Users with multiple monitors can get the overlay as a seperate, draggable window on their second monitor (display -> overlay_as_draggable_window).
* After a Steam patch, a new release will soon be available from https://github.com/roguelike2d/TekkenBot/releases
* If you suspect frame data is wrong, setting the dummy to block and jump and then holding up will make the live frame data display (tiny number above the big number) show the jump timing difference in frames, which is extremely accurate.
